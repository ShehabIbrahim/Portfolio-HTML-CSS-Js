    <p class="Bio" style="text-align: center">A Human-Computer Interaction undergraduate student at New Jersey Institute of Technology. There, I conduct HCI research with a talented Ph.D. candidate that has helped me hone my skills in the realm of UX/UI/IX design. I have quickly become an advocate of the user and pride myself in my ability to make meaningful connections with "Human and Machine."

        <br>It took a while to get this far.</br>

        <br>Before college, I was interested in all sorts of Multimedia. I joined the JCArts program in Jersey City, NJ and learned a good deal. I was even fortunate enough to take a Graphic Design course at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.</br>

        <br>I’ve always known that I wanted to work in the Tech industry. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft make the news constantly, and it seemed like the place to be.</br>

        <br> My moment of uncertainty started when I explained this dream to a high school teacher that I respected greatly. He expressed that I would be “stupid” to try and climb the “Tech Mountain” in a non-analytical field. The problem is, I agreed with him. I needed a field where my work wouldn’t be pushed to the side because of one-sided opinion or bias. I needed my work to stand its own ground.</br>
        <br>This story would be over if I found out about UX… this isn’t where I found out about UX.</br>

        <br>I was in the process of applying to college; I needed a major to which I would dedicate my entire life. With the dream of wanting to work in tech in mind, I decided Computer Science would be the most fitting.</br>

        <br>I ended up enrolling at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I learned a lot in this field. I became very fluent in Python, Java, HTML, CSS and more. I maintained good grades, put on the dean's list, and made friends. However, the field seemed empty to me. I had minimal creative control of how other visualized my work. I was able to be creative in the back-end side of things, but not where it mattered- the front-end.</br>

        <br>Throughout my awkward first semester fumbling through campus and meeting countless unfamiliar faces. I heard about someone talking about the HCI major- I was beyond curious.</br>

        <br>I ended up enrolling in IS 247- Designing the User Experience. In that class, I learned about a field that went completely under my radar. I worked hard in that class, and the professor took notice. At the conclusion of the course, I was invited to conduct research within the Connections Lab of New Jersey Institute of Technology.</br>

        <br>I still have a ways to go, but I’m content with how far I’m progressing.</br>

        <br>I’ve presently accepted an offer to work with Prudential Financial as a User Experience Intern in the Summer of 2019.</br>
